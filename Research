Alissa:
I am pretty sure that the majority of people have heard about Vlore when talking about the amazing Albanian Riviera but these cities have a lot more to offer except for the enchanting sea and extraordinary beaches.
Inside of every Albanian city there hides an ancient history and culture. 
Some destinations in Vlora:
	1. Kanine Castle
	It can be found approximately 6km away from Vlora. Its name has been mentioned as early as the fourth century. In this castle there have been found proof from the Illyrian byzantine, and Turkish periods. It is situated in the top of a hill approximately 380m above the sea level and it has an area of 36000 square meters. 
	2. Gjon Bocari's Castle
	Gjon Bocari's castle located in Tragjas is one of the most important culutral monuments in Vlore. It was built in a hill near Dukat's field, Tragjas and the famous village Radhime, which made possible the observation of the streets that lead to Llogara and Saint Gjergj. It is an architectural masterpiece that represents wonderfully the style of the 16th century, with ceiling higher than 4 meters and square with two polygonal towers at the north and east corners, while the single entrance, is located in the middle of one of the narrow sides of the quadrangle.
	3. Porto Palermo Castle
	This is one of the most famous castles in this zone probably because of its geographic position. It is mistaken quite often as a castle built from one the most notorious albanian rulers during the 19th century but this is untrue. It is believed that it has been built from the venetians since it has a lot of similarities with the triangular design with round towers found in the venetian fort at Butrint. Back to the geographic position,  it is located in a nearly island, in between of Qeparo and Himare, that is connected to the mainland by a narrow strip of land.
	4. The monastery of St. Mary
	5. Marimoroi's Church
	6. The Catholic Church of Vlora
	7. Muradie's Mosque

Some gorgeous bays include Orikum and Radhime but some lost and not easily accessible bays may be some of the best findings in Albania. All you need is a small boat and you will have the best calming days of your life chilling in the splendid beaches of the Albanian Rivera.
Some hidden bays include:
	1. Bay of Grama
	Grama Bay has served as a haven for ships in distress along this dangerous coast in difficult weather conditions. This bay initially served as an area of local stone exploitation, in large quarries, traces of which can still be seen today on both slopes.
	The name of Grama is clearly associated with the engraved inscriptions that in antiquity, the rock inscriptions were numerous in the bay of Grama, there are counted more than 1500 inscriptions, the Greek inscriptions are more ancient and belong to the last centuries before Christ, followed by some Latin inscriptions of the imperial period, before medieval Greek was predominant with inscriptions that most often refer to Jesus Christ.
	2. English bay
	English Bay is one of the natural beauties that Karaburuni offers. Hidden in the southern part of the peninsula, the bay can be visited through boat trips. The strategic position has made it also a haven for fishermen in case of danger.
	3. Dafina Bay
	Dafina Bay is one of the most special natural beauties that Karaburun Peninsula offers.
	A tourist who has explored Dafina Bay over the weekend says about this experience that, "you do not have to travel very far to visit this wonderful place called Dafina Bay which is located in the western part of Karaburun Natural Park".
